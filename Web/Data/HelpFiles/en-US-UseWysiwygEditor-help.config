<p>For most content instances you will want to use a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for ease of content editing. However, in some cases where you may want to edit directly using raw html to allow embedding JavaScript. The WYSIWYG editors allow you to edit the raw html, but they tend to apply "cleanup" logic which can remove things from your markup that you don't intend to have removed. So, for those cases you may want to uncheck this box and use a plain text area so that no "cleanup" is applied to your markup.</p>
