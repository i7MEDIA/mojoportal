<p>All major web browsers support OpenSearch, which enables users to search your site from their browsers location bar. This setting controls the displayed name of your sites search engine. If you leave it blank it will default to [your site name] - Search. Some browsers have stopped automatically adding OpenSearch supporting websites to the location bar so the user must go to settings to "Activate" the site search.</p>
