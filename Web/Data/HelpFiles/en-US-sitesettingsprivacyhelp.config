<p>Relative url for your site privacy policy. This can be any page on your site but it is probably best to use "/privacy", or a localized version of that name. The privacy page can be optionally excluded from your menu and shown in the site map and/or using a link in the footer of your skin's layout.master file. The privacy URL is required for using some 3rd party services.</p>
