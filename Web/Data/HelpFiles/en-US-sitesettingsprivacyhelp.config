<p>You should ideally create a page in your site with information about your privacy policies. We recommend you create the page using the url /privacy.aspx, but you can use something else or a localized version of that name. The privacy page can be optionally excluded from your menu and shown in the site map and/or using a link in the footer of your skin's layout.master file. The privacy URL is required for using some 3rd party services.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a privacy policy:</p>
